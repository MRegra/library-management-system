Library Management System Project in Java Spring Boot

A library management system is a software application that helps libraries to manage their collections, users, and operations. It can be used to automate tasks such as book cataloging, circulation, and reporting.

This library management system is developed in Java Spring Boot and React Typescript. It is a full-featured system that includes all the essential features of a modern library management system, such as:

    Book cataloging: The system allows librarians to catalog books and other library materials, including title, author, publisher, publication date, and genre.
    Circulation: The system allows librarians to track the circulation of books and other library materials, including who has borrowed them, when they are due back, and whether they have been renewed.
    User management: The system allows librarians to manage user accounts, including name, contact information, and library card number.
    Reporting: The system generates a variety of reports, such as a list of books that are due back soon, a list of books that are popular with users, and a list of books that need to be repaired or replaced.

The system is also highly customizable and can be extended to meet the specific needs of any library. For example, the system can be configured to support different types of library materials, such as DVDs, CDs, and audiobooks. The system can also be configured to support different types of users, such as students, faculty, and staff.
